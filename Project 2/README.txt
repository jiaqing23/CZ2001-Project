Make sure to put all execute file and input file in the same folder.

If want to compile, please put the pBar.cpp together with the c++ file you want to compile.

To run the programs:
just type .\[FILENAME].txt in the terminal, it will prompt you to input the necessary information.
For example: .\taskCD_nopath.exe (depends on different shell, might be ./taskCD_nopath.exe)

File with prefix "nopath" means it will just print the distance to the k-th nearest hospital(without the path).


The best performance for small k is taskCD_nopath.exe
To run big k, make sure the computer support for big memory spaces(O(kV)).

Output file is truncated because of the file size limit of NTULearn, the original file is 1.8GB in total.
